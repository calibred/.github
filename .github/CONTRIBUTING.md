We'd love for you to contribute to the Calibred projects, as long as you keep in mind a few guidelines:

### Do
- Open an issue using a Feature Request discussing your idea *before* you start implementing it. We cannot accept any and every change.
- Be prepared to (or help) write/update tests and benchmarks. We want to make sure everything works efficiently. This can also help demonstrate how features are used.
- Work with us on adding documentation for your feature proposal (to the README, as godoc comments or as release/commit messages.

### Don't
- Add comments such as 👍 and +1. Use the 👍 and 👎 reactions instead!

> If you discover a potential security exploit or vulnerability check our [Security Policy](https://github.com/calibred/.github/security/policy) and do not release said vulnerability to the public.
