# Security Policy

Have you found a security vulnerability in one of the [go-fresh](https://github.com/go-fresh) projects?

## Supported Versions
We support the latest production version of the Go-Fresh projects and the ones in public testing stages when handling security reports.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

[Send me an email](mailto:contact@deltarays.me?subject=GoFresh%20Security%20Report) or contact DeltaRays#0054 on Discord.
Make sure that you include all relevant information for us to handle the report. Thanks!


When reporting an issue, where possible, provide at least:

* The project and commit version in which the issue was found
* A proof of concept (in plaintext)
* The steps to reproduce the vulnerability
* If you have any recommendations, please let us know


> ⚠️ **Important!** Do NOT open issues for security vulnerabilities, as reporting a security vulnerability publicly is very dangerous.
